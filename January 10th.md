It's as if 'hacking' has been sanitized and transformed into 'making' - with politics, activism, tactics, history, economics and social issues removed in the process'
Making Critical Making - Garnet Hertz
Your mission is to 'write' history by making.
By translating something physical into the digital and back again.
Your work will look different.
this is ok

“The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction
Paul Valery: “Just as water, gas, and electricity are brought into our houses from far off to satisfy our needs in response to a minimal effort, so we shall be supplied with visual or auditory images, which will appear and disappear at a simple movement of the hand, hardly more than a sign.”									
During long periods of history, the mode of human sense perception changes with humanity’s entire mode of existence. The manner in which human sense perception is organized, the medium in which it is accomplished, is determined not only by nature but by historical circumstances as well.  
 The public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one. 						
Mankind, which in Homer’s time was an object of contemplation for the Olympian gods, now is one for itself. Its self-alienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order. This is the situation of politics which Fascism is rendering aesthetic. Communism responds by politicizing art. 
						
History of mona lisa is more than just the painting ex: copies made etc	
Precisely because authenticity is not reproducible, the intensive penetration of certain (mechanical) processes of reproduction was instrumental in differentiating and grading authenticity.  
The poorest provincial staging of Faust is superior to a Faust film in that, ideally, it competes with the first performance at Weimar 					
To satisfy the human interest of the masses may mean to have one’s social function removed from the field of vision. 
The definition of the aura as a “unique phenomenon of a distance however close it may be” represents nothing but the formulation of the cult value of the work of art in categories of space and time perception. 					
 To the extent to which the cult value of the painting is secularized the ideas of its fundamental uniqueness lose distinctness. 					
In the case of films, mechanical reproduction is not, as with literature and painting, an external condition for mass distribution. Mechanical reproduction is inherent in the very technique of film production.  					
This polarity cannot come into its own in the aesthetics of Idealism. 					
Bertolt Brecht, on a different level, engaged in analogous reflections: “If the concept of ‘work of art’ can no longer be applied to the thing that emerges once the				
work is transformed into a commodity, we have to eliminate this concept with cautious care but without fear, lest we liquidate the function of the very thing as well. For it has to go through this phase without mental reservation, and not as noncommittal deviation from the straight path; rather, what happens here with the work of art will change it fundamentally and erase its past to such an extent that should the old concept be taken up again—and it will, why not?—it will no longer stir any memory of the thing it once designated.” 					
“The film . . . provides—or could provide—useful insight into the details of human actions. . . . Character is never used as a source of motivation; the inner life of the persons never supplies the principal cause of the plot and seldom is its main result.” 					
method of exhibition caused by mechanical reproduction applies to politics as well.  	
Renaissance painting offers a revealing analogy to this situation 					
The work of art,” says André Breton, “is valuable only in so far as it is vibrated by the reflexes of the future.” 					
The theological archetype of this contemplation is the awareness of being alone with one’s God.  
. The film is the art form that is in keeping with the increased threat to his life which modern man has to face. 					
 As for Dadaism, insights important for Cubism and Futurism are to be gained from the movie. Both appear as deficient attempts of art to accommodate the pervasion of reality by the apparatus 
Mass reproduction is aided especially by the reproduction of masses.  		 	 	
 This means that mass movements, including war, constitute a form of human behavior which particularly favors mechanical equipment.
